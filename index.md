I am an **artificial intelligence engineer**, **imaging scientist** and **research software developer**.

I work for the NHS in the **Clinical Scientific Computing** department at Guy's & St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust.

Prior to this, I was a research fellow within the department of Perinatal Imaging & Health for **King's College London**.

My research used **magnetic resonance imaging** (MRI) to look at the tiny organs inside the **foetuses** of pregnant mothers.

More specifically, this work was focussed on **developing new imaging capabilities** for examining the foetal heart in greater detail than ever before.

Across all my roles, I work closely with clinicians and industry partners to **develop better software tools** for improving healthcare.
