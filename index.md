I am currently an **imaging scientist** and **software developer**.

I work in the department of Perinatal Imaging & Health for **King's College London**, based at St Thomas' Hospital.

My research uses **magnetic resonance imaging** (MRI) to look at the tiny organs inside the **foetuses** of pregnant mothers.

More specifically, my work is focussed on **developing new imaging capabilities** for examining the foetal heart in greater detail than ever before.

I also work closely with clinicians and industry partners to **develop better software tools** for improving diagnosis of disease and for more efficient hospital workflows.
