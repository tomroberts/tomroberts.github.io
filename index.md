title:  "Hello, I'm Tom Roberts"
---

I am an <u class="dotted_u">artificial intelligence engineer</u>, <u class="dotted_u">imaging scientist</u> and <u class="dotted_u">research software developer</u>.

I work for the NHS in the <u class="dotted_u">Clinical Scientific Computing</u> department at Guy’s & St. Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust.

Prior to this, I was a research fellow within the department of Perinatal Imaging & Health for King’s College London.

My research used <u class="dotted_u">magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</u> to look at the <u class="dotted_u">tiny organs inside the foetuses</u> of expectant mothers.

More specifically, this work was focussed on <u class="dotted_u">developing new imaging capabilities</u> for examining the foetal heart in greater detail than ever before.

Across all my roles, I work closely with clinicians and industry partners to develop <u class="dotted_u">better software tools</u> for <u class="dotted_u">improving healthcare</u>.
