## Hello, I'm Tom Roberts

I am currently an **imaging scientist** and **software developer**.

I work in the department of Perinatal Imaging & Health for **King's College London**, based at St Thomas' Hospital.

My work uses **magnetic resonance imaging** (MRI) to look at the organs and other small anatomical structures inside the **fetuses** of expectant mothers.

More specifically, my work is focussed on **developing new imaging capabilities** for examining the fetal heart in greater detail than ever before.

I also work closely with clinicians to **develop better software tools** for improved diagnosis of disease and more efficient hospital workflows.
